# Sample Boot2Gecko App

Just playing with a simple HTML/JS acceleration app for the new Boot2Gecko Mozilla phone handed out to all attendees of JSConf 2012.

## Install

* **I haven't yet been successful in making the web app installable via `navigator.mozApps.install` API** but you can still see the app work by browsing to: [http://accelo.evolvingbits.com/accelo](http://accelo.evolvingbits.com/accelo)

## Caveats

* The acceleration logic works fine on Boot2Gecko device but have noticed that the same code does the opposite movement on iOS. Haven't looked into yet.

## Acknowledgements

* Started with sample code from [http://ad.ag/wjmtgt](http://ad.ag/wjmtgt). More info: [http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/safari-ios-accelerometer-websockets-html5](http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/safari-ios-accelerometer-websockets-html5)
